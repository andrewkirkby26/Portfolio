        summary:
            "In my career, I've had the fortunate opportunity to develop software for robot communication and control, interact with databases, write REST APIs, and create comprehensive user interfaces for a diverse range of users. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to embrace any new challenge with an open mind and the confidence to solve them no matter how large. Collaborating with teams of varying sizes, alongside mechanical engineers, project managers, and QA engineers, has also enhanced my communication skills, enabling me to discuss complex issues with peers across different fields. Despite this, I also enjoy the challenge of handling an entire project as the sole developr from start to finish." +
            '<br><br>' +
            "Throughout my career, I've found great joy in mentoring my peers. Whether it's a new hire, an intern assigned to me, or a colleague who's been around for a few years, I've realized how rewarding it is to witness and help them excel, becoming the best software engineers they can be. I have had, and still have, many mentors who have helped me become more efficient and shown me the incredible aspects of our profession. I hope to do the same for my peers.",
